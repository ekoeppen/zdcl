## Zig Newton Desktop Connectivity Library

`zdcl` is a Zig library with tools to interact with Apple Newton MessagePads. It implements
the [Newton Docking Protocol](https://40hz.org/Pages/newton/hacking/newton-docking-protocol/) (also known as the 'Dante Protocol')
and can encode and decode [NSOF](https://www.newted.org/download/manuals/NewtonFormats.pdf) data.
